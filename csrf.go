package wui

// CSRFGuard defends the control-plane's state-changing routes (input submission,
// gate responses, interrupt, create/restore, and anything else this package mounts
// under a POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE method) against cross-site request forgery.
// HostOriginGuard (guard.go) already blocks a DNS-rebound host or a foreign Origin
// from reaching these routes at all, but Origin can be absent on some requests a
// browser is willing to send, and defense in depth here is cheap: CSRFGuard adds a
// second, independent check that doesn't rely on either header.
//
// Convention: wui mints one token per page load. TokenHandler (below) is the
// delivery mechanism: Handler (handler.go) registers it at
// GET /v1/csrf-token, and the SPA fetches it once, same-origin, caching the
// result in memory — never in a cookie, which would defeat the whole point of
// an independent, header-carried check. From then on the SPA echoes the token
// back on every state-changing request in the CSRFHeaderName request header.
// Wrap enforces this itself: it inspects the request method and only demands a
// valid token for POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE — GET, HEAD, and everything else
// pass through untouched (which is exactly why TokenHandler's own GET route needs
// no token to reach it: it is not itself state-changing).
//
// Wrap is nonetheless applied PER STATE-CHANGING ROUTE, never around the whole
// mux: wrapping the mux would make this guard intercept every mutating request
// BEFORE net/http's ServeMux resolves routing, turning every such request into
// a blanket 403 — including one aimed at a path with no route registered at
// all. See handler.go's registerControlRoute.
//
// Storage: minted tokens live in an in-memory map (process state, not durable —
// consistent with HostOriginGuard's process-lifetime posture), capped at
// maxCSRFTokens live entries with oldest-first eviction (see Mint and
// evictOldestLocked) and pruned of expired entries lazily, inside Mint only (see
// evictExpiredLocked) — verify (the check that runs on every control POST) never
// scans the whole map; see its own doc for why.
//
// Single-process constraint: this store is in-memory and lives on exactly one
// process. It does NOT support multiple replicas behind a load balancer sharing
// session-server duty — a token minted by one replica will never verify against
// another, since they don't share this map. This is an accepted v1 constraint,
// not a bug: this is a single-process local control plane today. If
// multi-replica support is ever needed, the fix is a STATELESS token design
// (nonce + expiry + an HMAC over both, keyed by a secret shared across replicas,
// verified with no shared state at all) rather than this in-memory map — do not
// build that speculatively; just don't silently violate this constraint by, say,
// putting two replicas of this process behind a shared load balancer without
// sticky routing.
//
// Threat model note on comparison timing (see verify's doc): verify checks a
// submitted token via a plain map lookup, not a constant-time comparison.
// This is a deliberate choice, not an oversight: each minted token carries
// 256 bits of crypto/rand entropy, so a timing oracle precise enough to
// matter would still need on the order of 2^128 online queries against a
// local server to exploit — not a real threat this guard needs to design
// around. The token's entropy is the actual security property here, not
// comparison timing.
