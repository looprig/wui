// TestBundleProtocolVersionReadsEmbeddedManifest pins the three versions the
// embedded bundle declares, by absolute literal.
//
// Deriving these from the files write-bundle-manifest.mjs reads would pin
// nothing: the assertion would hold for whatever those files happened to say,
// including a value that had drifted out from under the committed bundle. The
// literals are the point -- moving the pinned Core or the protocol package must
// require touching this test, which is where a reviewer is told the marker
// consumers read has changed.
//
// Release IS pinned here, by the same literal rule, and that is a change of
// premise rather than a tightening. It used to be excluded for a stated reason:
// "a literal false would make the release target fail its own gate, and a
// literal true would fail on every development commit". The first half still
// holds. The second half assumed the committed bundle is ordinarily a
// development build -- true until task U6.0-shipdist, which installed a
// `make release-dist` bundle as the tree this repository ships from here on.
// The module zip is source-only, so the committed tree IS the artefact every
// consumer embeds; it does not revert to a development build between releases,
// and a commit that made it one would be the defect, not the norm.
//
// So the literal is `true`, and what it catches is the accident that is now the
// realistic one: an ordinary `npm run build` overwrites dist/ with a marker
// saying release=false (the plugin reads WUI_BUNDLE_RELEASE, which only
// `make release-dist` sets), and that downgrade reaches a commit. `make
// dist-reset` restores the committed bundle.

// TestEmbeddedBundleReleaseClaimMatchesItsTree is the property a consumer gates
// on: the no-Node placeholder declares itself non-release (runbook 06, task
// U5.3), and Factory's default command refuses it on that basis (runbook 05,
// task A9.2).
//
// Stated as implications rather than as an equality, because the marker's value
// alone does not distinguish a legitimate tree from an illegitimate one. What
// is never legitimate is the placeholder claiming to be a release, and that is
// what a consumer would have no way to detect for itself -- it sees the marker,
// never the tree.
//
// The check is on the parsed marker rather than on the file's bytes: a consumer
// never sees the bytes, and a reader that silently defaulted Release to true
// would pass a bytes-level assertion.
//
// WHAT THIS TEST USED TO ASSERT, AND WHY IT NO LONGER CAN. Until task
// U6.0-shipdist it required `marker.Release == (WUI_BUNDLE_RELEASE == "1")`,
// an EQUALITY, on the premise that the committed bundle is a development build
// except during a release run. U6.0-shipdist installed a `make release-dist`
// bundle as the committed tree, which is what makes wui shippable at all --
// the module zip is source-only, so whatever is committed under dist/ is what
// every consumer embeds. Under that premise the equality is not merely weak,
// it is WRONG in the reverse direction: it makes `GOWORK=off make check` and
// `GOWORK=off go test ./...` -- the workspace's own standalone verification --
// fail for every developer and every CI run on a correct release tree. It was
// measured failing exactly that way before being replaced.
//
// The surviving direction is the one that is still invariant: a release run
// must produce a marker that claims a release. That catches the wiring defect
// release-dist.mjs's assertReleaseMarker catches from the Node side, from the
// Go side, and it is silent about a release marker outside a release run --
// which is now the ordinary state of this repository.
//
// The accident the dropped direction was aimed at ("a marker committed with
// release: true from an ordinary npm run build") is not lost: it is now covered
// better, and by its actual mechanism, in
// TestBundleProtocolVersionReadsEmbeddedManifest. An ordinary build writes
// release=FALSE, so the realistic downgrade is a false marker on a committed
// tree, and a literal pin is what sees it.
