// assets.go serves the embedded SPA build with the standard SPA-router
// fallback: a request for a real file under dist/ (JS, CSS, images, ...) is
// served as-is; any other request falls back to dist/index.html so client-side
// routes like /sessions/abc123 still return the app shell.
//
// dist/ holds a committed placeholder index.html: //go:embed requires the
// embedded path to exist at compile time, so this keeps go build / go vet /
// go test green with no Node toolchain installed. The real
// `npm run build -w app` later overwrites everything under dist/ except that
// committed file (see .gitignore).

// The all: prefix is required, not stylistic. A bare `//go:embed dist` applies
// the default walk rules, which silently skip every entry whose name begins
// with "_" or "." -- so a bundler that emits an underscore-prefixed chunk
// directory would produce a binary serving index.html and 404ing every asset it
// references, with no build error anywhere. `all:` disables that filtering.

// assetName maps an inbound request path to a path inside fsys, confined to
// assetRoot ("dist/..."). It never returns a path that can escape that root:
//
//   - "/" + reqPath forces the path to be rooted before cleaning, so
//     path.Clean's documented behavior -- "'..' elements that begin a rooted
//     path are replaced with a no-op", i.e. clamped at '/' rather than walking
//     above it -- applies unconditionally, regardless of how many ".."
//     segments reqPath contains.
//   - path.Join(assetRoot, clean) then Cleans again, so the result can only
//     ever be assetRoot itself or something rooted at "dist/".
//   - The HasPrefix check is defense in depth against that clamping behavior
//     ever regressing (e.g. a future refactor swapping path.Clean for
//     something else): any result that is not the root or root+"/" falls back
//     to the index rather than being opened.
//
// It deliberately does not percent-decode. net/http has already decoded
// URL.Path by the time a handler runs, and decoding again after cleaning would
// reintroduce the very traversal the clean just removed.
//
// io/fs additionally requires (fs.ValidPath) that names passed to Open contain
// no ".." elements and no leading "/" at all, and embed.FS enforces that itself
// -- so even a bug in this function that let a "../"-bearing name through would
// still be rejected by fsys.Open, not silently followed. This function exists
// anyway because CLAUDE.md requires paths to be cleaned and confinement-checked
// at the boundary, not because embed.FS's own check was found insufficient.
