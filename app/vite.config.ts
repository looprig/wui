/**
 * The development proxy for the Factory plane.
 *
 * `npm run dev` serves the SPA from Vite and forwards `/v1` to Factory, so the
 * browser talks to one origin: no CORS, no BFF (there is no BFF in this design)
 * and no rewriting of the `Origin` or `Host` a Factory guard needs to read.
 * Both halves of the plane live under the same prefix — REST reads and commands
 * at `/v1/...`, and the Centrifuge socket at `/v1/realtime` — which is why
 * `createFactoryClient` derives its realtime endpoint from the same `baseUrl`.
 *
 * "No CORS" is only half the sentence, and the other half is a configuration a
 * developer must make on the Factory side. `factory/internal/httpapi/guard.go`
 * runs a HOST rule BEFORE its Origin rule — `Guard.Check` calls `hostTrusted`
 * first and answers `ReasonHostNotTrusted` ("host_not_trusted") — and both
 * rules compare against the deployment's `TrustedOrigins`. Vite serves the page
 * on its own dev origin, not on Factory's, so every proxied request arrives
 * carrying that origin in BOTH headers. Factory must trust the Vite dev origin
 * or it answers `host_not_trusted` before routing, which looks like a broken
 * proxy and is not one.
 *
 * ## The target, and what it is not
 *
 * Factory has no `cmd/factory` yet (runbook 05, task A9.1) and therefore no
 * bind address of its own: there is no `factory/cmd` directory and no listen
 * call anywhere in `factory/`. `127.0.0.1:8722` is CARBON's — it is
 * `defaultServeAddr` in `carbon/cmd/carbon/main.go` — and it is a DEVELOPMENT
 * default, not a claim about where Factory listens.
 *
 * Know what that buys, because it is worse than a dead port. With `carbon
 * serve` running, `npm run dev` HALF-works: the LEGACY Host REST routes answer
 * (`harness/pkg/serve/mux.go` serves `GET /v1/sessions`,
 * `/v1/sessions/{sid}/events`, `/v1/sessions/{sid}/journal`), so the sessions
 * list and the transcript load and the app looks wired up — while
 * `/v1/realtime` reaches no Centrifuge endpoint at all, because `pkg/serve`
 * registers none. A dead port fails uniformly and diagnoses itself; this fails
 * on exactly the half that is new. **The Factory plane will not answer on this
 * port until A9.1 ships a binary that serves it.** A developer running Factory
 * elsewhere states so explicitly with `WUI_DEV_FACTORY_TARGET`.
 *
 * Safe for local use means three specific things, each of which has a reader in
 * `vite.config.test.ts`: the default is loopback and never a wildcard or a
 * remote host; an override that is not an absolute `http:`/`https:` URL is
 * REFUSED when the DEV SERVER's configuration is built — not at module load,
 * because `vite build` and every `vitest` run import this file and neither
 * serves a proxy (see the default export); and `changeOrigin` is left off, so
 * the browser's `Origin` and `Host` reach Factory unmodified rather than being
 * rewritten to the target's authority, which is exactly the header the Host
 * rule above reads.
 *
 * Exported, and asserted by `vite.config.test.ts`, because every one of these
 * is a single token in a file no other test loads.

 *
 * It is listed FIRST because Vite matches proxy entries in key insertion order
 * and takes the first whose context the request path starts with — but measured
 * (mutation M1), the order is NOT what makes the upgrade work: Vite's upgrade
 * handler skips every entry without `ws`, so `/v1` ahead of this one still
 * leaves the upgrade to this one, and with identical targets and no rewrite the
 * two orders are indistinguishable today. Most-specific-first is the convention
 * that stays correct if the two entries ever diverge; `ws: true` is the part
 * that is load-bearing, and removing it hangs the upgrade.
