 * Judges whether a built `dist` tree is one the Go side can actually serve.

 * Two independent faults, reported independently.
 *
 * **Skipped entries.** `//go:embed dist` — WITHOUT the `all:` prefix — silently
 * omits every path whose name begins with `_` or `.`, at every level of the
 * walk, not just the pattern's immediate children. The result is a binary that
 * compiles, starts, serves a blank page, and reports nothing anywhere.
 * SvelteKit's `_app/` is exactly this trap, sitting unnoticed in
 * `client/pkg/webui/dist` today. Vite's default `assetsDir: "assets"` produces
 * no such name; `wui/assets.go` uses `all:dist` as well. This check is what
 * makes both of those a pinned property rather than a coincidence.
 *
 * **A missing `index.html`.** It is the SPA fallback target and the tracked
 * placeholder `//go:embed all:dist` needs to exist at compile time on a machine
 * with no Node toolchain. A build that dropped it is a broken build.
 *
 * The two are separate fields rather than one list of strings: 05-app.md's
 * version returned `skipped: ["missing index.html"]`, which conflates them and
 * hides any genuinely skipped entry whenever the index is also absent.

/**
 * Scans already-read file contents for the properties U5.3's runbook step 3
 * requires of a released bundle and which, until now, were only ever checked
 * by hand: no source map files, no `sourceMappingURL` references in emitted
 * JS/CSS, no local filesystem paths, and no credential in one of the
 * well-known formats {@link SECRET_PATTERNS} lists.
 *
 * `secrets` is worth reading twice before trusting it: it recognises a fixed
 * list of provider credential formats, NOT secrets in general. An empty
 * `secrets` means "none of those formats is present", which is a useful thing
 * to know automatically and is not the same statement as "this bundle leaks
 * no secret". The runbook's secrets criterion is therefore partly automated
 * and still partly a reviewer's job.
 *
 * The four are independent fields, for the same reason `classifyDistEntries`
 * keeps its two independent: a tree can fail any subset of them, and folding
 * them into one list would hide whichever fault a test happened to construct
 * second.
 *
 * `sourceMapRefs` is scoped to files whose name ends `.js` or `.css` — the
 * runbook property is "no sourceMappingURL references in emitted JS or CSS",
 * and a comment or string containing the same words in, say, `index.html`
 * is not a leaked source map.
 *
 * `localPaths` and `secrets` are scanned across every file regardless of
 * extension — including binary assets — because a leaked build-machine path
 * or credential is exactly as real inside a font's embedded metadata as
 * inside a JS string, and grep makes no such distinction either.
 *
 * @param {readonly { path: string, content: string }[]} files Every FILE (not directory)
 *   in the tree, with its raw content already read. `content` should be read
 *   as `latin1` (one byte per code unit) rather than `utf8`, so scanning a
 *   binary asset for an ASCII byte pattern cannot itself throw on invalid
 *   UTF-8 and cannot re-encode bytes into different characters first.
 * @returns {{ ok: boolean, mapFiles: string[], sourceMapRefs: string[], localPaths: string[], secrets: string[] }}
 *   `secrets` entries are `"<path>: <format name>"`, so a failure names which
 *   pattern fired rather than leaving a reader to re-derive it.
