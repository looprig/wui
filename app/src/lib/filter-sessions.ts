/**
 * Filtering is client-side over the page already fetched: harness's list route
 * exposes no server-side filter, and the local catalogue a `carbon serve` host
 * has is small. When it stops being small the fix is a server-side filter and a
 * paging control, not a cleverer predicate here.
 *
 * Status reuses `toneFor` rather than comparing the wire string, so the filter
 * and the dot can never disagree about what "waiting" means. Search covers the
 * id and the title — the only two fields `SessionSummary` carries that a human
 * could search on. `state` is deliberately not searchable: it has its own
 * control, and matching it in free text would make "running" mean two things.
