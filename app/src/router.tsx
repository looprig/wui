 * the whole real application over real network globals.
 *
 * No credentials. Factory authenticates a browser on the origin that served the
 * page — session cookie plus the CSRF token carriage `wui/csrf.go` demands — so
 * there is no client-minted connection token to forward, and the link decides
 * at construction whether a token hook exists, so installing one for a caller
 * with no token provider installs a hook that can only fail. A deployment that

 * Every route, inside the Factory plane.

 * throws when no `<FactoryLinkProvider>` is above it, so the provider being an
 * ANCESTOR of the route outlet — rather than merely rendered somewhere in the
 * same tree — is checked at mount instead of being a layout accident. Rendering
 * the provider as a sibling of `<Outlet />` constructs a client and connects a
 * socket exactly as before, and until a route reads the Factory plane (U5.2)
 * nothing else in the application would notice.
 *
 * It reads the CLIENT rather than the link status on purpose: the client is a
 * stable value held in the provider's ref, so this subscribes to nothing and
 * re-renders the whole route tree on no state change.

/**
 * TanStack Router with BROWSER history, not hash history.
 *
 * Capstan's platform design §7 pins TanStack Router with hash history; we take
 * the router and depart on the history, because wui's Go side (`wui.Assets()`)
 * already serves the SPA fallback, so `/sessions/<uuid>` is a real, linkable,
 * refreshable path. Hash history exists for hosts that cannot do that. If a
 * consumer ever mounts the SPA under a sub-path, add `basepath` here.
 *
 * ## What the routes are handed
 *
 * Adapters, never globals. The Factory composition is constructed here and
 * threaded through the route tree, so a test can build a whole application over
 * doubles with no module mocking — and, just as importantly, so that nothing
 * below this file reaches for `fetch`, `WebSocket` or Centrifuge by itself.
 *
 * The Factory provider sits on the ROOT route rather than in `main.tsx`. The
 * root route component is mounted once for the lifetime of the router and
 * wraps every child, which is the same lifetime `main.tsx` would give it, and
 * it keeps the whole composition inside the one function a test can call.
 * `FactoryLinkProvider` constructs its client in a ref rather than a `useMemo`,
 * so StrictMode's double mount still yields exactly one client and one socket.
