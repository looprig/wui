/**
 * One transcript row, routed to the component that renders its kind.
 *
 * There is no `gate` row. 05-app.md's dispatcher has one, and
 * `@looprig/protocol`'s projection does not: the five kinds are
 * user/assistant/tool/notice/tombstone, and gates live in `SessionView.gates`
 * keyed by gate id, reached through `useGate`. A gate is not a point in the
 * transcript — it can be opened and resolved while rows keep appending around
 * it — so the page renders open gates in their own region.
 *
 * ## Why `memo`
 *
 * The transcript hands each row a per-row selector's value, and rows are
 * copy-on-write in `@looprig/protocol` (design §3c), so an unchanged row is
 * reference-identical and this subtree is skipped. The per-row selector ALONE
 * is not enough: `Object.is` bail-out only suppresses store-driven re-renders,
 * and a parent that re-renders because one row was appended descends into every
 * child regardless. Without `memo`, appending to a 10,000-row transcript
 * re-renders 10,000 rows.
 *
 * The other half matters just as much: `memo` must not be so sticky that a
 * completed tool call keeps saying "running". Copy-on-write is what makes the
 * replacement fire, and `transcript-row-view.test.tsx` pins both directions.
