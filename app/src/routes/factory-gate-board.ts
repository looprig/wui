/**
 * The open gates of one Factory session, folded from the two sources that
 * disagree about them: the bounded `GET /gates` page, and the live journal.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * `foldPublicGatePage`'s own comment states the race it cannot fix and names
 * the two shapes that can: a TOMBSTONE keyed by `(SessionID, GateID)`, or a
 * REBUILD from `emptyPublicGateBoard()` per page set. This module is the
 * tombstone, and the choice is not a preference:
 *
 *  - A rebuild does close page resurrection, and that is what the detail route
 *    did before this file existed. But `useFactorySessionView` reads
 *    `listGates(sessionId, { limit })` — a BOUNDED window with no continuation
 *    — so rebuilding makes "absent from this page" mean "closed". That is
 *    exactly the inference the requirement forbids: a gate a human still has to
 *    answer would vanish from the screen because a later page was truncated,
 *    and nothing would ever bring it back.
 *  - A rebuild also folds no live resolve. Nothing in the view removes a gate
 *    from `view.gates`; only the next `listGates` does. A gate answered in
 *    another tab therefore stayed on screen — with its attested `resident`
 *    answerability, so `acceptsResidentResponse` reported a closed gate as
 *    answerable — until a status read happened to refresh the page.
 *
 * A tombstone is the shape that says both things at once: a page MERGE never
 * removes (absence is not resolution), and a `GateResolved` this client
 * actually observed removes its own key and keeps removing it, so a page read
 * before the resolve and merged after it cannot resurrect the gate.
 *
 * ## What a tombstone is allowed to outlive
 *
 * A gate id is a durable single-use identity: it is opened once and resolved
 * once, so within one journal a permanent tombstone needs no sequence
 * comparison — and this layer has none to make, since a page carries no fetch
 * time and no tip. What it may NOT outlive is the journal it was taken from.
 * `generation` is that scope: a superseded fold applies nothing, and a NEW
 * generation drops the board and every tombstone with it, because a rewound or
 * re-scoped journal is not the one the resolve was observed in.

 * poll re-renders every gate card forever.
 *
 * The whole event window is re-folded on every call rather than only its new
 * tail. That is deliberate: every operation here is idempotent — a tombstone is
 * a set member, a duplicate `GateOpened` is a referential no-op in
 * `foldPublicGateEvent`, and a page merge that changes nothing returns its own
 * argument — so re-folding cannot double-count, and a high-water mark would
 * silently skip an older `GateResolved` that arrives through `browseEarlier`.

/**
 * The view the detail route hands `useFactoryGate`.
 *
 * ## Generations, and how they are observed here
 *
 * `useFactorySessionView` does not expose a generation, so this derives one
 * from the two transitions that mean "the journal these gates came from is no
 * longer the journal I am reading":
 *
 *  - `gates` going NULL after being non-null. `FactoryColdJoin` nulls the whole
 *    projection on an authoritative `unauthenticated`, `not_authorized` or
 *    `session_not_found`. Keeping a tombstone across that would let a decision
 *    taken about a session Factory says is gone suppress a gate in whatever
 *    the next authorized read returns. This condition is REDUNDANT DEFENCE
 *    today and is named as such rather than left to be mistaken for a live
 *    guard: `#rejectAccess` publishes `coveredThrough: 0` in the same snapshot
 *    that nulls `gates`, and a tombstone can only exist if a `GateResolved` at
 *    journal_seq >= 1 was observed, so the floor always falls too. Removing it
 *    alone is an equivalent mutant, measured; removing BOTH conditions fails
 *    "an authoritative invalidation drops the board and its tombstones". It
 *    stays because the two facts are independent — a projection reset that did
 *    not zero coverage would still be one — and because the intent is the
 *    invalidation, not the arithmetic.
 *  - `coveredThrough` FALLING. A lower committed floor is the protocol's own
 *    reset signal — a Factory replica change or an overflow — and the view
 *    prunes its event map on exactly the same condition.
 *
 * Both are compared against what the previous render observed, and a new
 * `sessionId` starts a fresh cell, so the derivation is idempotent: React may
 * render this component twice for one commit (StrictMode does it always), and
 * the second pass sees no transition and folds the same inputs onto a state
 * that already absorbed them. Every operation in `foldFactoryGateView` is
 * idempotent for the same reason, which is what makes a render-phase
 * accumulator safe here rather than merely convenient.
