// HostOriginGuard defends against DNS rebinding. Loopback binding alone does not
// stop it: a malicious web page can get a victim's browser to resolve an
// attacker-controlled DNS name to 127.0.0.1, then have client-side JS make a
// same-origin-shaped fetch() to that name. No CORS preflight fires for a "simple"
// request, and the browser's same-origin policy doesn't help either — the
// attacker's page and the rebound name share nothing the browser checks.
// `carbon serve` binds loopback by default and holds the rig in-process, so
// without this guard a malicious page could drive a rebound connection straight
// to a fully-permissioned coding agent.
//
// The guard checks what DNS rebinding cannot forge: the Host header the server
// actually received (net/http populates r.Host from the request line/Host header,
// never from anything the browser's origin-based sandboxing controls) and, when
// present, the Origin header. Both must name one of a small set of allowed hosts.

// an Origin naming a DIFFERENT port (or, for that matter, a different
// loopback host form entirely — 127.0.0.1 vs localhost vs [::1] — even
// though each is independently allowed as a Host) is a different origin by
// browser same-origin rules and must be rejected here, even though a naive
// "is the hostname one of the allowed forms" check would have let it
// through. (Because hostAllowed already validated hostHeader itself before
// this function is ever called, requiring exact equality to it automatically
// inherits that guarantee — there's no need to separately consult
// g.allowedHosts here.)
//
// Scheme is ignored deliberately, not by oversight: a TLS-terminating
// reverse proxy in front of this handler can make the Origin's scheme (https,
// as seen by the browser) differ from what this process itself sees on its own
// listener (http) — and http and https can never both be live on the same
// host:port in a normal deployment, so scheme-blindness here is safe. Port
// was the actual gap this function used to have: a same-host, different-port
// origin (e.g. a Vite dev server on :5173, or any other local process on any
// other loopback port) used to pass this check, which combined with no CSRF
// delivery mechanism once meant any page on any loopback port could reach
// this module's control routes. See csrf.go's TokenHandler for the other half
// of that fix.
//

// "null" browsers send for some sandboxed/cross-origin contexts), or one
// carrying userinfo (e.g. "http://evil.example@127.0.0.1:7777/" — real
// browsers never construct an Origin header with a userinfo component, so
// this isn't exploitable under the actual threat model, but url.URL.Host
// ignores userinfo entirely, so without this explicit check such an Origin
// would otherwise be compared on its userinfo's *host* portion alone), all
