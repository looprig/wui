package wui

// bundle.go exposes the embedded SPA build's protocol marker.
//
// The module zip is source-only and `go get` runs no build step, so whatever is
// COMMITTED under dist/ is what every consumer's //go:embed all:dist serves.
// That makes the bundle a versioned artefact in its own right: the JavaScript in
// it speaks a particular sessionwire version, was built against a particular
// pinned Core, and carries a particular @looprig/protocol build. None of those
// are properties of the Go source beside it, which is why they are read out of
// the bundle rather than declared as constants here -- a constant would keep
// saying the right thing while the tree beneath it went stale, which is exactly
// what wui v0.1.0 shipped (retracted; see go.mod).
//
// app/scripts/write-bundle-manifest.mjs writes the file, from the three
// authorities that own the three values; vite.config.ts's bundleManifestPlugin
// calls it on every build so the marker is produced by the same step that
// produces the bundle. This file only reads and validates it.
