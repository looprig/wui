// Public barrel for @looprig/react — the reference React adapter over
// @looprig/protocol.
//
// Every hook here is a thin useSyncExternalStore shell. Nothing in this package
// parses a wire shape, folds an event, or decides transcript ordering: that all
// belongs to @looprig/protocol, and a Vue or Solid author installs that one
// package and writes their own equivalent of this file.
//
// `src/testing/` is deliberately NOT exported. It is fixture code for this
// package's own tests, not a published test-kit.
