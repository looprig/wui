/**
 * Classifies a `SessionViewStore`'s two out-of-band channels into one reactive
 * connection status.
 *
 * ## Why the classification needs both channels
 *
 * `subscribeErrors` carries three different things and does not label them:
 *
 *  - a `FoldError`, which fold.ts's contract says is NON-FATAL — the join skips
 *    one bad input and keeps going;
 *  - a live-frame-queue overflow, also non-fatal — frames were dropped;
 *  - the failure that terminated the join, which is followed by the store going
 *    inactive.
 *
 * Collapsing all three into one `error` field would tell a renderer to tear the
 * transcript down for a single malformed delta. So a `FoldError` is recorded as
 * a warning immediately, by contract, and anything else is held as a CANDIDATE:
 * the store emits a terminal failure and goes inactive in the same synchronous
 * turn (pinned by `protocol/test/store-lifecycle.test.ts`), so if the
 * liveness transition arrives before the candidate's own microtask, that error
 * ended the join; if the microtask wins, nothing ended and it was a warning.
 *
 * The residual ambiguity is exactly one case: a non-`FoldError` warning
 * followed by an explicit `stop()` inside the same microtask turn would be
 * reported as the failure. `stop()` comes from a React cleanup and an overflow
 * from the pump, so they are never in the same turn in practice, and the
 * mislabel would be a stopped connection shown with a real error attached.
 *
 * ## Why liveness cannot come from the notify channel
 *
 * `commit()` is a no-op when nothing is dirty, so a stream that ends cleanly
 * with no pending update notifies nobody. That is what
 * `SessionViewStore.subscribeLifecycle` exists for.
 *
 * Nothing in this file imports React.

 * Owns one `ClientLink` for the whole application and hands each session view a

 * ## Why the link cannot belong to the session view
 *
 * A `ClientLink` is one WebSocket. A route-scoped link means one socket per open
 * session, a fresh version negotiation and a fresh authorization per route
 * change, and — under React StrictMode, whose whole purpose is to run a mount,
 * an unmount and a second mount — a real chance of two live sockets where the
 * code reads as if there is one. So the link is constructed above the route and
 * this store is what a view is given: `bind()` in, publications out.
 *
 * ## The three properties this class exists to hold
 *
 *  - **One connect per loss, not one per binding.** Every binding observes the
 *    same disconnection and every one of them asks to recover; `#ensureConnected`
 *    coalesces those into a single in-flight `link.connect()`.
 *  - **Each binding rejoins on its own.** A session the server declines to
 *    re-authorize fails alone: its peers stay subscribed and keep delivering.
 *  - **Every binding is cancelled exactly once.** Teardown and the view's own
 *    cleanup both cancel, in an order React does not fix, so the guard is in the
 *    binding rather than in either caller.
 *
 * Nothing in this file imports React.
