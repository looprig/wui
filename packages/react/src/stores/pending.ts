/**
 * One logical user action, one command identity, retained until it reaches a
 * durable outcome.
 *
 * ## Where the identity lives, and where it deliberately does not
 *
 * `@looprig/protocol`'s `PendingCommand` already owns the retry-stable half:
 * it snapshots the exact V1 envelope once, `retry()` replays those same bytes
 * without minting a replacement, and `submit()` throws
 * `CommandIdentityMismatchError` on a reply naming another command. What it
 * does NOT own is WHICH envelope a control is currently holding — a class with
 * no name for "the input command this session's composer is waiting on" cannot
 * stop a second click from constructing a second one.
 *
 * That naming is what this module adds, and it is scoped to
 * `FactoryClient.commands` — the command plane — NOT to `FactoryLinkStore`.
 * The link is a socket: it reconnects, it drops bindings, it knows nothing
 * about user actions, and hanging pending-command state off it would tie the
 * lifetime of a durable identity to the lifetime of a transport.
 *
 * ## Why the retained envelopes outlive the store that made them
 *
 * A React component unmounts for reasons that have nothing to do with the
 * command it sent: a route change, a suspense boundary, a `key` change,
 * StrictMode's own mount/unmount/mount. If the envelope died with the
 * component, the retry after a remount would mint a NEW identity — which is
 * exactly the duplicate logical command this whole task exists to prevent, and
 * it would be minted by the recovery path rather than by the user.
 *
 * So the slots live in a `WeakMap` keyed by the `FactoryCommands` instance —
 * i.e. by the application's one command plane, released when the client is —
 * and sub-keyed by session. A store instance is a VIEW onto them: it adopts
 * whatever is retained the moment it attaches, which is what makes a remount
 * inherit rather than restart. Nothing is keyed by component identity, because
 * component identity is precisely the thing that does not survive.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT serialized
 *
 * A scope is one session, and within a scope a slot is one CONTROL (the
 * composer's input, the interrupt, one gate). Two sessions therefore never
 * contend, and neither do the composer and a gate in the same session: a
 * retained envelope blocks a second envelope for ITS OWN control and nothing
 * else. A single global "one command in flight" latch would be simpler and
 * would be wrong — one slow session would freeze every other tab pane.
