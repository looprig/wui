/**
 * The write half of the chat composer.
 *
 * Holds no draft text: what the user is typing is ordinary component state
 * bound to a textarea, and this store is only the transport-facing path — the
 * same division `client/sdk/svelte/src/interaction.svelte.ts` draws.
 *
 * ## Why the pending rows live here and not in the fold
 *
 * `@looprig/protocol` has its own optimistic-pending-row mechanism —
 * `addPendingRow(view, commandId, blocks)` appends a real `UserRow`, and
 * `resolveCommand` removes it on `TurnStarted`/`TurnFoldedInto`/`TurnRejected`/
 * `InputCancelled`. It is UNREACHABLE through `SessionViewStore`:
 * `joinSessionView` owns its own `view` local and yields it on every event, and
 * the store assigns `this.current = event.view` unconditionally, so anything a
 * consumer folded into `current` between two frames is discarded by the next
 * one. There is no injection point on either the store or the join generator.
 *
 * So the pending rows are kept here, as per-tab state beside the shared fold,
 * and `reconcile()` retires them from the one signal that IS observable through
 * the store: `SessionViewSnapshot.view.commandOutcomes`. That map is the only
 * place resolution can be seen — `TurnRejected` commits a NOTICE row rather
 * than a user row and `InputCancelled` commits none at all, so scanning `rows`
 * cannot do it.
 *
 * A renderer therefore draws `view.rows` and then these, in that order. They
 * are per-tab either way: a second tab, or the TUI, sees nothing for this
 * submit until `TurnStarted`.
