/**
 * A page of session summaries, fetched on mount and whenever `query` changes

 *
 * Two React-specific hazards, both handled here rather than in the store:
 *
 *  - `query` is almost always an inline object literal, so an effect keyed on
 *    its identity would refetch on every render. The effect depends on the two
 *    scalars instead. 04-react.md keyed on `JSON.stringify(options)` and then
 *    `JSON.parse`d it back; that is both order-sensitive (`{skip,limit}` and
 *    `{limit,skip}` serialize differently and would spuriously refetch) and
 *    silently lossy for a caller-supplied `AbortSignal`, which is why
 *    `SessionListQuery` exists rather than `ListSessionsOptions`.
 *  - the request is aborted on unmount, and under StrictMode's
 *    mount/unmount/mount the first request's abort rejection lands after the
 *    second request has already started, so `RefreshGuard` discards it. Both
 *    mechanisms are needed: the abort frees the socket, the guard keeps the
 *    stale rejection out of `error`.
 *
 * `refresh()` deliberately carries no signal. It has no unmount hook of its
 * own, and after an unmount its result is discarded by the store nobody is
 * subscribed to anyway; giving it one would mean tying a user-initiated retry
 * to the lifetime of whichever effect happened to run last.
