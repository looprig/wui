/**
 * One session's connection state, as a renderable value.

 * This is the hook the design brief's §6.10l is about: the plan assumed `live`
 * and `error` were fields on the view snapshot, and they are not. Errors arrive
 * on `SessionViewStore.subscribeErrors`, a separate, deliberately
 * NON-COALESCED channel, and liveness on `subscribeLifecycle`. Neither is on
 * the snapshot, and neither can be: coalescing two errors inside one frame
 * would collapse them to one, and an error immediately followed by a success
 * would vanish entirely.
 *
 * A NON-FATAL error and a terminal one are kept apart rather than folded into
 * one `error` field:
 *
 *  - `warningCount` / `lastWarning` — the fold skipped one bad input, or the
 *    live queue dropped frames. The join kept going and `connected` stays
 *    true. Render this as a badge, never as a teardown.
 *  - `failure` — this ended the join. `connected` is false and `state` is
 *    `"failed"`.
 *
 * See `stores/connection.ts` for how the two are told apart.
 *
 * This hook does NOT start or stop the store; `useSessionView` owns that. Pass
 * it the same store.

 * the moment each is folded.
 *
 * `onError` is held in a ref, so an inline arrow (which is every real call
 * site) does not tear the subscription down and reopen it on each render — an
 * error delivered in that window would simply be lost.
