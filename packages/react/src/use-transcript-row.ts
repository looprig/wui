 * `@looprig/protocol`'s fold appends the outer array IN PLACE (design §3c, for

 * changes and a selector returning it would never re-render at all.

 * Returns the row OBJECT straight out of the snapshot — never a copy, never a
 * derived shape. Rows are copy-on-write in `@looprig/protocol` (rows.ts's
 * module comment, and `test/rows.test.ts` freezes committed rows to keep it
 * that way), so this selector's result is `Object.is`-stable until that
 * specific row changes, which is what lets React skip re-rendering every other
 * row in a 10,000-row transcript when one tool call completes.
 *
 * The selector must therefore stay a plain index. Reading `snapshot.version`,
 * or spreading the row, would subscribe every mounted row to every notify and
 * turn one completed tool call into a whole-transcript re-render — which is
 * the regression `use-transcript-row.test.tsx` pins.
 *
 * `undefined` when the ordinal is past the end: a virtualizer routinely renders
 * ahead of the data, and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` makes that the honest
 * return type rather than a lie the caller finds at runtime.
