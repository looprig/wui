 *
 *  - `subscribe` is memoized on the store's identity. An inline arrow would
 *    make React tear down and reopen the subscription on every single render.
 *  - `select` MUST return something that already lives in the snapshot — a row
 *    object, a number, a string. It must NEVER build a fresh object or array,
 *    because `useSyncExternalStore` compares with `Object.is` and a fresh
 *    object is never equal to itself; React detects the resulting loop and
 *    throws "The result of getSnapshot should be cached to avoid an infinite
 *    loop". Derive shapes in `useMemo` on the value this returns, not in here.
 *
 * `select` is deliberately NOT memoized: React reads it during render and
 * stores it through a ref, so its identity is free to change. Only the VALUE
 * has to be stable.
