/**
 * A controllable `ClientLink` for this package's tests.
 *
 * `@looprig/protocol` builds its real link over Centrifuge and exposes only
 * `createClientLink` from its barrel — `createClientLinkWithTransport`, the
 * seam its own `clientlink.test.ts` drives, is not public — so a React test
 * cannot reach the real adapter with a fake socket underneath it. This stands
 * in for it.
 *
 * The semantics mirrored from `protocol/src/clientlink.ts`, each because a test
 * here depends on it:
 *
 *  - `connect()` returns the SAME promise while one is in flight and an
 *    already-resolved one once connected, which is what makes a coalescing
 *    claim about `FactoryLinkStore` a claim about the store rather than about
 *    the link;
 *  - `disconnect()` rejects a pending connect;
 *  - `subscribe()` returns synchronously with `ready` still pending, so a
 *    binding exists before it is authorized;
 *  - `unsubscribe()` is accepted any number of times, so "exactly once" is a
 *    property of the caller, never of this fake;
 *  - **one live subscription per session.** Centrifuge keeps a per-channel
 *    registry and `newSubscription` THROWS on a second entry; `unsubscribe()`
 *    on the real link releases it. `ClientLink over real Centrifuge` in
 *    `protocol/test/clientlink.test.ts` reads three things off the library: the
 *    second-subscribe throw, the guard against a stale handle detaching its
 *    successor, and the resubscribe-after-unsubscribe the rejoin path needs.
 *    This fake ALSO declines to release a failed subscription, and that fourth
 *    property is INFERRED rather than measured — driving a real subscription
 *    into an errored state takes a server, so no subtest there reaches it. The
 *    inference: centrifuge 5.7.2 empties `_subs` only through
 *    `_removeSubscription`, which has exactly one call site, the public
 *    `removeSubscription` that `CentrifugeSubscriptionAdapter.release` calls.
 *    No error path can hand a channel back, so a rejoin after an error must
 *    release before it subscribes, exactly as it must after a silent transport
 *    loss. A fake that accepted overlapping subscriptions would turn that throw
 *    into a passing test, which is what it did until this was added.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT mirrored, because nothing here reads them: schema validation
 * of publications (the real link validates and routes `session.reset` by its
 * `type` member; this one is handed already-typed values) and the token/data
 * option plumbing.
 *
 * Three differences remain after auditing this against `clientlink.ts` in both
 * directions, and none of them is inert:
 *
 *  - **Centrifuge's own automatic reconnect and resubscribe.** The real link
 *    revives an existing subscription across a transport reconnect by itself, so
 *    publications can keep arriving on a subscription `FactoryLinkStore`
 *    believes it must rejoin; here they stop until the store resubscribes. The
 *    cost is that this fake cannot show a failed rejoin being MASKED by live
 *    publications — which is precisely why a failed rejoin goes unnoticed in a
 *    browser — only whether the rejoin happened. `onRejoin` is therefore the
 *    signal these tests assert on.
 *  - **`ready` after an unsubscribe.** The real link REJECTS a `ready` that has
 *    not settled when the subscription is torn down; `unsubscribe()` here leaves
 *    it pending forever. `FactoryLinkStore` observes that rejection and ignores
 *    it, so the two agree on what the store does — but a future consumer that
 *    reads `ready` for a teardown signal would be tested against the weaker one.
 *  - **`deliver()` on an unsubscribed subscription.** The real link stops
 *    routing publications once the subscription is gone. `deliver()` is a test
 *    ACTION rather than something this fake produces on its own, and one test
 *    uses it deliberately to model a frame the socket had already handed up
 *    before the unsubscribe; nothing calls it by accident. `link.open` is the
 *    accessor to reach for when the question is what a live subscription
 *    delivers.
