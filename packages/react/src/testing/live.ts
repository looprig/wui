/**
 * A hand-driven `LiveFrameSource` plus the SSE frame fixtures every hook test
 * in this package folds.
 *
 * ## Frame shapes are the decoder's, not this file's opinion
 *
 * The envelope shape below mirrors `packages/protocol/test/helpers.ts`, which
 * was checked against verbatim `event.MarshalEvent` stdout from
 * `github.com/looprig/harness@v0.30.0`: a `type`/`v` discriminator merged as
 * SIBLING keys into the promoted header fields plus the type-specific payload.
 * There is no nested `header` key inside an enduring envelope, every
 * zero-valued UUID is ABSENT rather than all-zeros, and message-level fields
 * are snake_case while content BLOCK fields are Go-cased (`Text`), because the
 * Go block types carry no json tags.
 *
 * Ephemeral `delta` field names are snake_case too — `chunk_type`,
 * `tool_execution_id`, `tool_name`, `is_error`, `result_preview`. Getting the
 * ephemeral/enduring casing backwards is the single most likely defect in this
 * work, so `live.test.ts` proves every builder here by FOLDING it.

 * leak `client/sdk/svelte/src/live-session.svelte.ts` was written to close and
 * `@looprig/protocol`'s `SessionViewStore` carries forward: calling `.return()`
 * on the JOIN generator queues behind an in-flight `.next()` and never lands,
 * so a store that only does that leaves a live connection open for the rest of
 * the session.
 *
 * Every connection owns its own buffer, parked reader and closed flag.
 * 04-react.md's version kept all of that on the INSTANCE, which is wrong the
 * moment two connections overlap — and they do, on every session switch and
 * every reconnect. Measured: switching `sessionId` gave 3 opens and 2 closes
 * instead of 2 and 1, because `joinSessionView`'s `finally` calls
 * `liveIterator.return()` best-effort AFTER the store already cancelled, and
 * with shared state that second, late `return()` closed the NEXT store's
 * connection — which `autoReconnect` then dutifully reopened.
