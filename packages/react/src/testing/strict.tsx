/**
 * `renderHook` under a REAL StrictMode double-mount.
 *
 * ## Why `vitest-browser-react`'s own `wrapper` is not enough — measured
 *
 * 04-react.md (Tasks 4.8 and 4.17) opts into StrictMode with
 * `renderHook(hook, { wrapper: strict })`, where `strict` renders
 * `<StrictMode>{children}</StrictMode>`. That does NOT double-invoke effects.
 * Measured on 2026-08-28 against react 19.2.8 + vitest-browser-react 2.2.0, one
 * `useEffect(fn, [])` counting its own mounts:
 *
 *   render(<StrictMode><C/></StrictMode>)              -> 2 mounts, 1 cleanup
 *   render(<Wrapper/>), StrictMode inside Wrapper      -> 1 mount,  0 cleanups
 *   render(<Wrapper><C/></Wrapper>), same as `wrapper` -> 1 mount,  0 cleanups
 *
 * The double-RENDER still happens one level down (the hook body runs twice), so
 * the tree really is in strict mode — it is only the mount/unmount/remount
 * simulation that is driven by the root. `vitest-browser-react` applies
 * `wrapper` INSIDE the root element (`strictModeIfNeeded(wrapUiIfNeeded(ui,
 * Wrapper))`), so a wrapper can never put StrictMode at the root.
 *
 * That makes half of the plan's Task 4.8 hollow, and precisely the half the
 * task exists for. A `wrapper` still double-INVOKES `useMemo`, so it does catch
 * a store factory with side effects. It never remounts, so it catches nothing
 * about restartability — measured: with `wrapper: strict`, making protocol's
 * `SessionViewStore.start()` a permanent no-op after the first `stop()` leaves
 * all four of `use-session-view.strict.test.tsx`'s tests GREEN, which is the
 * exact failure Task 4.8's own step 2 says to expect. With this helper, three
 * of the four fail.
 *
 * This helper puts `StrictMode` at the root element instead, which is the one
 * arrangement that produces the remount, and `strict.test.tsx` pins that.
 *
 * `configure({ reactStrictMode: true })` from `vitest-browser-react/pure` would
 * also reach the root, but its `config` lives in a different optimized bundle
 * from the default entry's `render` (verified: toggling it there leaves the
 * default entry's render single-pass), and switching every render in this file
 * to `/pure` would also drop the global `beforeEach(cleanup)` the setup file
 * registers.
