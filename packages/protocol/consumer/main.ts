/**
 * A vanilla TypeScript consumer of the PACKED `@looprig/protocol` tarball.
 *
 * This file is copied into a temporary directory outside the npm workspace,
 * compiled by `tsc` against the installed tarball, and run by `node`. It is the
 * executable half of runbook 06 task U6.1 step 2: join a session, submit a
 * retry-stable command, repair a reset, and page a tool object without
 * importing React.
 *
 * READ THIS ABOUT "WITHOUT IMPORTING REACT". Not importing React is something
 * this file could achieve by simply not typing the word, which would prove
 * nothing at all. `assertFrameworksAreUnresolvable` below therefore asserts the
 * MECHANISM instead: from this consumer's resolution root, `react`,
 * `react-dom`, `svelte`, `@sveltejs/kit`, `@looprig/harness` and
 * `@looprig/react` are not resolvable modules -- an `import` of any of them
 * could not compile or run here even if this file did contain it. Its
 * anti-vacuity half asserts in the same breath that `@looprig/protocol` IS
 * resolvable, so a run in which every dynamic import happened to fail cannot
 * pass. The two together are the deliverable: a consumer that CANNOT import
 * React, not one that merely does not.
