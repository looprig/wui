/**
 * A fake Factory ClientLink.
 *
 * Unlike the REST half there is no way to serve real bytes here without a
 * Centrifugo server, so this IS a test double for `ClientLink` -- the shape the
 * brief calls out as most likely to be looser than the dependency it stands in
 * for. It is therefore written against the published `ClientLink` type and
 * against the observable behaviour of `CentrifugeClientLink`, and the
 * behaviours below are the ones the join actually depends on. Each is stated
 * with the reason it is not an invention of this file.
 *
 *  1. `subscription.version` is `undefined` until the LINK has negotiated.
 *     `CentrifugeClientLink.subscribe` returns `authorized ? this.negotiated?.version
 *     : undefined`, and `negotiated` is set by the transport's `connected`
 *     event. `joinFactorySessionView` repairs when `subscription.version !== 1`,
 *     so a double that reported 1 without a connection would hide a missing
 *     `connect()` in the consumer.
 *  2. `ready` resolves only on server authorization, never synchronously at
 *     construction. The real one resolves on the transport's `subscribed`
 *     event.
 *  3. one live subscription per channel. Centrifuge's `newSubscription` THROWS
 *     on a second subscription for a channel that has not been removed, and
 *     `ClientSubscription.unsubscribe` is documented as also DETACHING the
 *     channel for exactly this reason. The join subscribes once per generation
 *     and unsubscribes in a `finally`, so a double that allowed two live
 *     subscriptions per channel would not notice a leaked one.
 *  4. `unsubscribe` is idempotent and never detaches a SUCCESSOR that has taken
 *     the same channel.
 *  5. every published record is validated with the package's own validators
 *     before delivery, and delivery is refused before `ready`. The real link
 *     parses each publication through `validate*` and can only receive one
 *     after the transport reports `subscribed`.
 *  6. `rpc` refuses a request that is not a V1 command envelope and echoes the
 *     caller's `command_id`, because that is the property `PendingCommand`
 *     checks (`CommandIdentityMismatchError`) and a double that minted its own
 *     id would make every identity assertion vacuous.
