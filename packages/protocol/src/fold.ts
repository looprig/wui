/**
 * Session state-machine fold: turns the two independent event streams the SDK
 * can observe — a cold `StatusEvent[]` page replayed from
 * `GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/journal` and a live `SseFrame` stream from
 * `sse.ts`'s `SseFrameParser`/`parseSseStream` — into ONE accumulated
 * `SessionView` shape. This is the "single event DTO flows through both
 * history and live" seam: a renderer only ever needs to know `SessionView`,
 * never which segment (cold journal page vs. live SSE) an update came from.
 *
 * ## Why `fold()` takes a discriminated `HistoryInput | LiveInput`, not a bare
 * `StatusEvent | SseFrame` union
 *
 * `StatusEvent` (`additionalProperties: false`, only `journal_seq`/`event`)
 * never carries a `type` key, while every `SseFrame` variant's `type` is
 * required — so the two ARE structurally distinguishable without a wrapper.
 * A wrapper is used anyway because it makes the call site's intent
 * (`{ segment: "history", event }` vs. `{ segment: "live", frame }`)
 * self-documenting rather than relying on a reader noticing the absence of a
 * field, and it gives `fold()` an unambiguous compile-time discriminant to
 * switch on instead of a runtime structural sniff.
 *
 * ## The exhaustiveness guarantee (the reason this module exists)
 *
 * `ephemeral_frame.schema.json`'s `kind` is a proper TypeScript string-literal
 * union (`FromSchema` resolves its `enum` to
 * `"token_delta" | "tool_call_started" | "tool_call_completed" |
 * "input_queued" | "compaction_started"` — confirmed empirically, not
 * assumed), so `foldEphemeral`'s switch over `frame.kind` uses the standard
 * `never`-typed default-case idiom: if the schema's `kind` enum ever grows a
 * 6th value and this switch isn't updated to handle it, the assignment
 * `const exhaustive: never = frame.kind` in the default case stops compiling
 * — `npm run typecheck` fails BEFORE the gap can ship. Until that day, the
 * default case is unreachable in a well-typed caller, but a caller that
 * constructs a frame via `as`/`as any` (this module's own tests do exactly
 * that, to simulate a future wire addition) reaches it at runtime, where it
 * produces a typed `FoldError` (`reason: "unknown_ephemeral_kind"`) — never a
 * thrown generic exception, never a silent no-op. See fold.test.ts's
 * "unknown ephemeral kind" case and its throwaway verification (documented in
 * this task's report) that commenting out a real case actually breaks
 * `tsc`.
 *
 * `frame.delta`, in contrast, has NO such compile-time backing:
 * `ephemeral_frame.schema.json` types it as a bare `{"type":"object"}` with no
 * `properties`/`oneOf`-by-`kind`, so `FromSchema` resolves it to
 * `{ [x: string]: unknown } | undefined` regardless of `kind` — confirmed
 * empirically the same way. The kind-specific shapes below
 * (`TokenDeltaChunk`, `ToolCallStartedDelta`, `ToolCallCompletedDelta`,
 * `CompactionStartedDelta`) are hand-authored from harness's actual encoder
 * (`pkg/serve/ephemeral.go`'s `textChunkDTO`/`thinkingChunkDTO`/
 * `toolUseChunkDTO`/`refusalChunkDTO`/`imageChunkDTO`/`toolCallStartedDelta`/
 * `toolCallCompletedDelta`/`compactionStartedDelta` structs — all FIVE chunk
 * variants of `encodeChunkDelta`'s sealed union, because a variant this parser
 * does not know surfaces as a fold ERROR to a user who is only watching a
 * model stream), not from the vendored JSON Schema, and
 * are validated by hand-rolled runtime guards below rather than ajv (there is
 * no per-kind schema to compile). A malformed `delta` (present but missing an
 * expected field, wrong type) yields a typed `FoldError`
 * (`reason: "malformed_delta"`) rather than propagating `undefined`s or
 * throwing — same "never silently drop" discipline as sse.ts's
 * `SseFrameError`, extended one layer further into the payload sse.ts itself
 * does not (and per its own docs, deliberately does not) interpret.
 *
 * ## Gates ARE folded here — the map, not the marker
 *
 * This module used to say gates could not be folded, because
 * `event_envelope.schema.json` leaves the per-type payload wholly open and
 * there was no vendored schema to validate one against. That was a statement
 * about SCHEMAS, and it does not survive: `MarshalEvent` merges the full
 * type-specific payload into the envelope as sibling keys and the journal
 * replays those bytes verbatim, so the payload is a real durable contract with
 * or without a schema document. enduring.ts decodes it against bytes harness's
 * own codec produced, and gate.ts decodes the gate envelope those bytes carry.
 *
 * So `foldEnduringEnvelope` now does both: it appends the generic
 * `StatusEventMarker` exactly as before (nothing that reads `statusEvents`
 * regresses, and the long tail is still covered by it) AND routes the two
 * public gate events into `SessionView.gates`. That is the "kind-specific case
 * alongside the generic fallback, mirroring how `foldEphemeral` is structured"
 * this comment always named as the extension point — a widening, not a
 * redesign.
 *
 * `GatePrepared` is not handled and never needs to be: it is the private
 * prepared record, the replayer filters it out of journal pages, and it never
 * fans out to SSE.

 * The row is only EXTENDABLE while it is the loop's LAST row. Once a tool row
 * lands after it the prose row is closed, and the next delta opens a new one —
 * which is exactly the "text -> tool call -> text within a turn" interleaving
 * that the separate `content`/`toolCalls` buckets cannot express (§3c).
 *
 * That wholesale replacement is what makes the absent `step_id` irrelevant.
 * harness's `stampStepID` stamps `StepID` on exactly five event types and
 * `TokenDelta` is not one of them — `stampLoopHeader` fills a TokenDelta header
 * turn-scoped, so a delta carries session/loop/turn and no step. A delta
 * therefore cannot be grouped by step; it does not need to be, because it
 * always belongs to its loop's CURRENT in-flight step, and the enduring commit
 * replaces the accumulation rather than merging with it. Deduplication needs no

 *
 * Design §3c: "The outer array may be appended in place." Copying it per event
 * made a cold journal replay O(M^2) before first paint, which is the exact path
 * the row projection exists to serve. It is safe because NOTHING holds an older
 * `SessionView` and expects it frozen: `joinSessionView` keeps one reassigned
 * `view` variable, and the only place it hands back a PREVIOUS view is a failed
 * fold -- which appends nothing, so "previous" and "current" are the same value
 * there anyway. No consumer diffs two views.
 *
 * The consequence is real and deliberate: a caller that DOES retain an older
 * view sees the newer rows through it, while that stale object's `nextOrdinal`
 * stays where it was. Retaining a view is therefore not supported; retaining a
 * ROW is, and that is what the per-row selectors actually do.
 *
 * ## What stays copy-on-write, and is asserted
 *
 * - Row OBJECTS. Completing a tool card or extending the live segment builds a
 *   NEW object (`replaceRow`), so a `useSyncExternalStore` per-row selector
 *   comparing with `Object.is` re-renders exactly the row that changed.
 *   test/rows.test.ts freezes committed rows, so even a value-preserving
 *   write-through throws.
 * - The Maps (`gates`, `loops`, `pending`, `commandOutcomes`).
 * - Every NON-append edit: `replaceRow`, `dropLiveRows`, `dropEmptyLiveProse`,
 *   `commitLiveRows` and `resolveCommand` all build a new array. The carve-out
 *   is for APPENDS only, and narrowly so: an append leaves an older view
 *   holding a coherent PREFIX, while a replacement or a removal would rewrite
 *   history it had already shown.
 * - A FAILED fold appends nothing. Every push above happens after the case's
 *   validation, which is what keeps the view `join.ts` yields on error correct.

/**
 * ## Why this is not `SessionView.gates`
 *
 * `SessionView.gates` is the per-session LIVE fold: it exists only where a
 * journal replay or an SSE stream exists, and it holds the full runtime
 * `gate.Gate` envelope. The board below answers a different question — what
 * gates are open, across sessions, for a client that has just loaded and has
 * no Host, no live subscription and no journal at all. Its only required source
 * is `GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/gates`, which spec §7 makes a pure durable read.
 *
 * Two consequences follow, and both are why this is a separate structure
 * rather than a second map on `SessionView`:
 *
 *  - it is keyed by `(SessionID, GateID)`, because it spans sessions and a
 *    GateID is only unique within one;
 *  - it holds the REDACTED `PublicGateProjection`, not `Gate`, because the cold
 *    source is `additionalProperties: true` at every level and the only safe
 *    thing to keep is a named allowlist (see gate.ts's
 *    `GATE_PROJECTION_WIRE_FIELDS`).
 *
 * ## Merge rules
 *
 * An entry has three parts, each with its own writer:
 *
 *  - IDENTITY AND OPEN POSITION (`sessionId`, `gateId`, `openedEventId`,
 *    `openedJournalSeq`) are written ONCE, on first observation, and never
 *    rewritten. They are facts about one durable `GateOpened`. Writing them
 *    once is also what makes the public order stable under a duplicate.
 *  - ATTESTED STATE (`deadline`, `answerability`) is written ONLY by a gate
 *    page, last page wins. A live journal event never writes it: an open event
 *    proves presentation and never answerability, so a gate seen only live is
 *    unattested and `acceptsResidentResponse` refuses it.
 *  - PRESENTATION (`kind`, `prompt`) is written by a page, and by a live open
 *    only when the entry is new.
 *
 * A live `GateResolved` removes its own key. A page merge never removes: a gate
 * that resolved while this client was offline stays until its `GateResolved` is
 * folded or the board is rebuilt from `emptyPublicGateBoard()`. That is a
 * stated limitation, pinned by test, not an oversight — a page can be one
 * cursor page of several, so "absent from this page" does not mean "closed".
 */

 * Merges one `GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/gates` page into the board.
 *
 * `sessionId` is a parameter because the page does not carry one: it is
 * addressed by URL, so only the caller knows which session it read. An empty
 * one is a caller error and throws — folding two sessions' pages under `""`
 * would merge them, which is the exact confusion the pair key exists to stop.
 * (A gate EVENT, by contrast, names its own session, so `foldPublicGateEvent`
 * reads it from the envelope and never takes it from a caller.)
 *
 * RETURNS THE IDENTICAL BOARD when the page applies nothing — every record
 * already present and equal, or every record unkeyable, or no records at all.
 * This is not a micro-optimisation, and the sentence is here because it is
 * asserted with `toBe`, not because it reads well. The page path is the one a
 * cold client POLLS, and `packages/react`'s `useStore` requires a selector to
 * return something already in the snapshot, so a consumer derives its list as
 * `useMemo(() => publicGates(board), [board])`. A board rebuilt on every
 * unchanged poll produces a fresh array and re-renders every gate card
 * forever. The live duplicate has the same guarantee for the same reason.

 *
 * A page merge never removes (see `PublicGateBoard`), and the inverse race is
 * real too: a page fetched BEFORE a `GateResolved` but merged AFTER it
 * RESURRECTS the resolved gate, complete with whatever `answerability` the

/**
 * Whether a re-merged record would change anything a consumer can observe.
 *
 * Field-by-field rather than a structural walk, because it must be exactly the
 * fields `PublicGateEntry` HAS: a comparator that silently ignored a field
 * added later would make `foldPublicGatePage` swallow a real update, which is
 * the worse direction of the identity guarantee. test/fold-gates.test.ts
 * enumerates every projected leaf name from `GATE_PROJECTION_WIRE_FIELDS` and
 * partitions it into the ones that must change the board and the ones that
 * must not, so this list cannot fall behind the projection.
 *
 * FOUR of the twelve comparisons are UNREACHABLE at the one call site, for two
 * different reasons, and all four are named because declaring SOME dead
 * comparisons implies the rest are live — a partial list is a claim, not a
 * courtesy. Each is an equivalent mutant: removing it survives the suite, and
 * that is the expected result rather than a gap. The other eight are live and
 * each dies on the leaf-partition case.
 *
 *  - `sessionId` and `gateId` are established by the KEY. `prior` is read from
 *    `publicGateKey(sessionId, gateId)`, which is injective, and `b` is built
 *    from those same two values, so two entries under one key agree on both.
 *    They stay because their disagreement is exactly the "entries from
 *    different keys were compared" confusion the pair key exists to stop.
 *  - `openedEventId` and `openedJournalSeq` are established by ASSIGNMENT, more
 *    directly still: in the `prior !== undefined` branch the candidate is
 *    literally built with `openedEventId: prior.openedEventId` and
 *    `openedJournalSeq: prior.openedJournalSeq`, so it cannot differ. They
 *    become LIVE the moment the write-once rule above is dropped, which is
 *    precisely why they should stay — they are the comparator's half of that
 *    rule. test/fold-gates.test.ts's `immutable` partition asserts the FOLD
 *    behaves this way; it cannot reach the comparator, and nothing here
 *    pretends otherwise.
