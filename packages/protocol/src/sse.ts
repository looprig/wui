/**
 * SSE (Server-Sent Events) line-framing parser for harness's live event
 * stream (`pkg/serve/ephemeral.go`, `pkg/serve/handlers_events.go`).
 *
 * This is a real line-parser over raw bytes, NOT the browser's built-in
 * `EventSource` — `EventSource` can only be pointed at a URL (it owns the
 * whole connection and offers no way to feed it synthetic chunks), which
 * makes it untestable with the chunk-boundary scenarios this module exists
 * to get right. Instead:
 *
 *  - `SseFrameParser` is the synchronous core: `feed(chunk: Uint8Array)`
 *    consumes one arbitrarily-sized chunk of bytes and returns every frame
 *    that chunk completed. This is what the unit tests below drive directly
 *    with hand-split byte arrays.
 *  - `parseSseStream(stream: ReadableStream<Uint8Array>)` is a thin async
 *    generator wrapper for real usage against `fetch()`'s streaming
 *    `response.body`.
 *
 * ## Wire format (confirmed against `contract/schema/enduring_frame.schema.json`,
 * `ephemeral_frame.schema.json`, and their fixtures — see those files'
 * `description`s, which are the authoritative source for this framing):
 *
 *   `event: enduring\nid: <journal_seq>\ndata: <json>\n\n`   -- id: ALWAYS present
 *   `event: ephemeral\ndata: <json>\n\n`                     -- id: NEVER present
 *   `: ping\n\n`                                             -- heartbeat comment
 *
 * Frames are separated by a blank line, per the SSE spec
 * (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#event-stream-interpretation).
 * This parser implements that general line-processing algorithm (comment
 * lines, `field: value` lines with the single-leading-space-stripped rule,
 * multi-line `data:` accumulation joined by `\n`) rather than a narrower
 * ad hoc format, since it costs little extra and the wire format is a
 * subset of full SSE, not a divergent one.
 *
 * ## Design decision: heartbeats are a distinct yielded frame, not silently
 * dropped.
 *
 * Strict SSE dispatch semantics (a comment-only block sets no `data`, so a
 * generic client's "message" listener never fires) would already make a
 * heartbeat invisible to a naive caller for free. This module yields it
 * explicitly instead (`{ type: "heartbeat" }`) because the information the
 * wire actually sent — "the connection is alive, nothing new happened" — is
 * useful at the call site (e.g. resetting a stale-connection timeout) and
 * cheap to ignore (`if (frame.type === "heartbeat") continue;`) for callers
 * that don't care. Silently eating it would throw that signal away with no
 * way to recover it later.
 *
 * ## Design decision: a malformed frame yields a typed error frame; it does
 * NOT throw and does NOT halt the stream.
 *
 * `{ type: "error", error: SseFrameError }` is yielded in place of the
 * frame that failed to parse/validate (bad JSON, ajv rejection, missing
 * `id:` on an `enduring` frame, an unrecognized `event:` value). Parsing
 * resumes normally on the next frame. This is a deliberate departure from
 * this package's usual "parse, don't cast; throw on violation" discipline
 * (`validate.ts`'s `ContractValidationError`, `transport.ts`'s typed HTTP
 * errors) — those guard a single request/response, where surfacing the
 * failure as a rejected promise is the whole story. A live SSE connection is
 * a long-lived multiplexed sequence of independent, self-delimited frames:
 * one server bug or transient encoding glitch on a single event (frequently
 * an `ephemeral` progress tick, not journal-critical) should not force the
 * caller to tear down and reconnect the entire stream, losing every
 * following frame along with it. Concretely:
 *  - `feed()`/`parseSseStream()` throwing would mean ONE bad `ephemeral`
 *    frame kills delivery of every subsequent `enduring` frame too, which is
 *    strictly worse for a caller that only cared about the durable events.
 *  - The internal buffering state is never corrupted by a bad frame either
 *    way (each frame is parsed from its own bounded block, reset at every
 *    blank-line dispatch) — that invariant holds regardless of this choice,
 *    it's tested separately (see sse.test.ts's "internal buffer state" case
 *    following a malformed frame).
 *  - The caller still gets a fully typed, non-silent signal
 *    (`SseFrameError`, with the raw block text and, where available, the
 *    underlying `cause`) and can choose its own policy: log and continue,
 *    count/alert past a threshold, or itself decide to tear down the
 *    connection. Silently dropping the bad frame (no error frame at all)
 *    was rejected for the same reason `validate.ts` never returns `null` on
 *    failure — a caller should never have to wonder whether "fewer frames
 *    than expected arrived" means "nothing happened" or "something was
 *    silently thrown away."
 *
 * ## Bounded buffering, and an O(n) (not O(n²)) scan for an unterminated line
 *
 * `feed()` appends every chunk to an internal buffer and looks for the next
 * line terminator; a line that never terminates (a very large single
 * `data:` line delivered across many small reads — realistic given a
 * reverse-proxy's own read-and-flush-immediately behavior, not just
 * adversarial input) would otherwise make that buffer grow without bound
 * AND make every `feed()` call rescan the whole thing from byte 0 looking
 * for a terminator that isn't there — O(n²) total work for one huge line.
 * `MAX_BUFFERED_LINE_BYTES` bounds the growth (an oversized line becomes a
 * typed `ErrorSseFrame`, same as any other malformed frame, rather than an
 * unbounded allocation); `SseFrameParser.scanFrom` fixes the rescan (each
 * `drain()` call only scans the newly appended suffix, not bytes a prior
 * call already confirmed contain no terminator) — see both symbols' own doc
 * comments for the detail.
 *
 * ## Chunk-boundary / UTF-8 safety
 *
 * Bytes are decoded incrementally with `TextDecoder`'s `{ stream: true }`
 * mode, which is specifically designed to hold back a not-yet-complete
 * multi-byte UTF-8 sequence at the end of a chunk until the remaining bytes
 * arrive in a later chunk, rather than emitting a corrupt/replacement
 * character. Line-splitting then operates on the decoded string buffer, not
 * raw bytes, so a chunk boundary landing anywhere at all — mid multi-byte
 * character, mid line, mid `data:` JSON value, exactly on the blank-line
 * separator — cannot corrupt or drop a frame: incomplete trailing text
 * simply stays in the buffer until the next `feed()` call supplies the rest.
 * (None of the current fixtures contain non-ASCII bytes, so this specific
 * property isn't exercised by golden-fixture bytes today; it follows from
 * `TextDecoder`'s documented streaming contract rather than from anything
 * fixture-specific, and is reasoned about explicitly since it can't be
 * pinned down with real multi-byte fixture content yet.)
