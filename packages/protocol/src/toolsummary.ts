/**
 * The redacted one-line detail a COLD-REPLAYED tool card shows, derived from
 * the stored `content.ToolUseBlock.Input`.
 *
 * ## Why a summariser and not the raw input
 *
 * A LIVE tool card's `summary` is harness's own `ToolCallStarted.Summary`
 * (`pkg/serve/ephemeral.go`'s `toolCallStartedDelta`), computed server-side and
 * already redacted. The enduring record carries no such field — an ephemeral
 * frame is never persisted — so a card committed from `StepDone.Messages` has
 * to derive one, and it has to land in the same place the live card did. A card
 * that showed `path (12 bytes)` while streaming and the file's entire contents
 * on reload would be two different cards for one call, and the second of them
 * would render an editor's worth of payload into a transcript row.
 *
 * That is also why this exists rather than a `ToolRow.input` field. The input
 * is already on the wire inside `StepDone.Messages`, so carrying it would leak
 * nothing new — but it would grow every row (Phase 5 virtualises the
 * transcript) and it would put the redaction decision in each renderer, where
 * every renderer would have to make it again and one of them would get it
 * wrong.
 *
 * This is a port of tui's `internal/presentation/toolsummary.go`, and it is
 * deliberately a straight one: two transcripts of the same session should not
 * describe the same call differently.
 *
 * ## Tool knowledge, and the boundary it does not cross
 *
 * The table below names tools. That is presentation knowledge — how a call
 * reads to a human — and not the dependency CLAUDE.md rules out: nothing here
 * imports a tool package, executes anything, or makes a policy decision, and an
 * unknown name is not an error, it is a card with no detail line. New tools and
 * MCP tools land in the `default` arm and render their name alone.
 *
 * ## The Go decoder semantics this replicates
 *
 * tui decodes with `json.Unmarshal` into a small tagged struct per tool, and
 * two of encoding/json's behaviours are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **A type mismatch on any mapped field fails the whole decode**, and every
 *    summariser returns "" on the error. Fail closed: rendering less than the
 *    input said is safe, rendering something it did not say is not.
 *  - **Field matching is exact-first, then case-insensitive**, so `{"Command":
 *    "ls"}` still reaches a `json:"command"` field. Replicated so a card does
 *    not go blank here while tui renders it.
 *
 * A non-object input is an `Unmarshal` error and yields ""; a literal `null`
 * (the wire form of a nil `json.RawMessage`, which `Input` has no `omitempty`
 * to suppress) decodes as a no-op into the zero struct, which every summariser
 * then renders as "" too. One guard covers both because the outputs are
 * identical.
