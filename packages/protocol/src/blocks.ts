/**
 * Decoders for harness's content-block wire shapes.
 *
 * There is no vendored JSON Schema for a block payload (event_envelope
 * .schema.json leaves the per-type payload open — see the module comment in
 * fold.ts), so these are hand-authored runtime guards, exactly like fold.ts's
 * own parseTokenDeltaChunk.
 *
 * ## The casing rule
 *
 * core/content/block.go declares TextBlock, ThinkingBlock, ToolUseBlock and
 * RefusalBlock as bare structs whose VISIBLE fields carry no json tags, so
 * encoding/json emits the exported field name verbatim:
 * {"type":"text","Text":"hello"}. The "type" key is merged in by MarshalBlock
 * as a sibling, not declared on the struct.
 *
 * ToolResultBlock is the ONE exception: it nests []Block, so it defines its
 * own MarshalJSON over a tagged wire struct (block_json.go's toolResultJSON),
 * and its fields are snake_case: tool_use_id / content / is_error.
 *
 * The rule: a block type with a hand-written codec is snake_case; a bare
 * struct is Go-cased. Never "normalize" one to the other. Both halves are
 * pinned in test/blocks.test.ts against bytes core's own codec produced,
 * because reading the wrong key yields empty strings and NO error.
 *
 * ## The tagged fields that do not break the rule
 *
 * ThinkingBlock and ToolUseBlock are not literally tag-free: SignatureFormat,
 * ProviderState and ProviderStateFormat carry `json:"...,omitempty"` tags. The
 * tags restate the Go field name, so the casing conclusion is unchanged, but
 * the fields are real wire. They are dropped here on purpose. They are
 * provider-private continuation state whose only use is replaying a turn back
 * to the dialect that minted it — replaying one provider's state to another is
 * a guaranteed rejection, which is why core labels each one with its issuer.
 * wui renders; it never replays. Forwarding opaque provider bytes into a
 * browser has no reader and is a leak.
 *
 * Unrecognized blocks (image/audio/document, and anything added later) are
 * preserved as an opaque `other` variant rather than dropped, so a renderer
 * can show a placeholder instead of silently losing turn content.
