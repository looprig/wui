/**
 * Per-type decoding of the ENDURING event payloads.
 *
 * Before this module, fold.ts folded every enduring envelope into one opaque
 * StatusEventMarker, so opening a session that already ran rendered a blank
 * transcript: the prose lives in StepDone.Messages and TurnDone.Message,
 * inside that payload. fold.ts's own module comment names this as the
 * intended extension point:
 *
 *   "When gate payloads get a real vendored schema, `StatusEventMarker` is the
 *    natural extension point (a `kind`-specific case alongside the generic
 *    fallback, mirroring how `foldEphemeral` is structured), not a redesign."
 *
 * This is that extension. The payload is not opaque ON THE WIRE — MarshalEvent
 * merges the full type-specific payload into the envelope as sibling keys
 * (mergeEnvelope in harness/pkg/event/marshal.go) and the journal replays
 * those bytes verbatim — so these decoders document an existing durable
 * contract rather than inventing one. Per-type JSON Schemas are authored in
 * harness (design §8) and vendored into wui/contract/; the fixtures are
 * validated against them by the contract suite, not here.
 *
 * The long tail (ContextMeasured, hustle and workflow events) is deliberately
 * NOT decoded: it keeps the generic `other` payload, exactly as before.

 * True when a wire id means "unset".

 * uuid.UUID is a `[16]byte` whose zero value is the zero array — so the
 * ORDINARY production encoding of a zero id is an ABSENT KEY, not "000…0".
 *
 * The all-zeros spelling is real anyway. harness's own
 * pkg/serve/fixtures_test.go normalises its golden bodies with a regexp that
 * REPLACES every uuid with the zero uuid, so the fixtures vendored into
 * wui/contract/ carry the key with a spelled-out zero value. Both forms are

 * exactly this predicate. Writing `cause?.loop_id === undefined` instead would
 * render a phantom user message on any hand-back whose producer spelled the
 * zero out. Any other STRING — a real loop id, or a near-miss like a zero uuid
 * with one digit flipped — reads as NON-zero and suppresses the user row.
 *
 * A non-string value never reaches this predicate at all: decodeEnduring
 * projects every id through `str()`, so a corrupted `"loop_id": 42` arrives as
 * "" and reads as ZERO, committing the row. That is the decoder's uniform
