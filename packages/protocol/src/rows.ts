/**
 * The transcript row projection (design §3b/§3c).
 *
 * `SessionView.content` and `SessionView.toolCalls` are separate append-only
 * buckets with NO shared ordering key, so "text -> tool call -> text within a
 * turn" cannot be reconstructed from them: the interleaving is lost the moment
 * two updates land in different arrays. `rows` is ONE append-only array with a
 * monotonic ordinal, folded from the SAME inputs, so arrival order survives.
 *
 * ## Rows are copy-on-write
 *
 * Completing a tool call REPLACES the row object; it never mutates it.
 * Mutating in place would leave the row's identity unchanged, so a
 * `useSyncExternalStore` per-row selector comparing with `Object.is` would
 * never re-render the completed card.
 *
 * The OUTER array is a different matter and was carved out deliberately
 * (design §3c): `fold` appends into it in place, because copying it per event
 * made a cold journal replay O(M^2) before first paint. That carve-out covers
 * appends only, and it does NOT extend to the row objects — test/rows.test.ts
 * freezes committed rows so that even a value-preserving write-through throws,
 * and test/fold-immutability.test.ts records the amendment and what still
 * holds either side of it.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * Rows are partitioned by `loopId` (see `rowsForLoop`) and are NEVER sorted
 * globally by `journalSeq` — that is what makes "a subagent's TurnDone has a lower seq than
 * the parent turn containing it" harmless. Within a loop, committed rows order
 * by the `journalSeq` of the COMMITTING event. `ordinal` is the append order
 * and the stable React key; `journalSeq` is the ordering key within a loop.
 *
 * ## Redacted reasoning
 *
 * A redacted thinking block reaches the wire as
 * `{"ProviderState":"…","ProviderStateFormat":"anthropic","Signature":"",
 * "Thinking":"","type":"thinking"}` and an empty one as
 * `{"Signature":"","Thinking":"","type":"thinking"}` (both verbatim from
 * core@v0.6.0's codec). The two ARE distinguishable on the wire — but the
 * distinction was destroyed one layer below this one, because blocks.ts drops
 * `ProviderState`/`ProviderStateFormat`: provider-private continuation bytes
 * with no reader in a browser. This projection then saw `thinking === ""` and
 * committed NO row for a step whose only content was redacted reasoning, so
 * the turn rendered with a hole in it. (Tool rows always committed, so only
 * pure-redacted steps vanished.)
 *
 * The fix is where it belonged: `ThinkingBlockValue.redacted`, a DERIVED
 * boolean in blocks.ts that forwards no provider bytes. `redactedThinkingOf`
 * projects it and `AssistantRow.redactedThinking` carries it. The bytes still
 * never reach the browser; only the fact that something was withheld does.
