/**
 * Runbook 06 task U6.1 steps 1-3: prove the framework-neutral artifact.
 *
 * `test/surface.test.ts` already installs the packed tarball into a throwaway
 * fixture and imports one value from it. This file is the different thing U6.1
 * asks for: a real CONSUMER, compiled by its own `tsc` and run by `node`
 * outside the npm workspace, that drives the package's whole advertised
 * capability set -- join, retry-stable commands, reset repair and paged tool
 * objects -- against a fake Factory REST/ClientLink pair, plus the dependency
 * inspection step 3 names. The consumer's own sources live in
 * `packages/protocol/consumer/` so they are reviewable rather than string
 * literals in a test; this file only packs, installs, compiles, runs and
 * inspects.
 *
 * THE TWO NEGATIVE ASSERTIONS, AND WHY EACH HAS A POSITIVE CONTROL
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Step 3 asks for two findings of the form "nothing was found": no
 * React/Svelte/Harness dependency, and no workspace-only `0.0.0` reference. An
 * inspection that runs over the real input and returns an accurate-looking
 * empty answer while being blind is indistinguishable from a correct one, so
 * neither claim is made without a KNOWN-ANSWER input driven through the SAME
 * function:
 *
 *  - `frameworkClosure` is exercised by `installedClosureFixture`, a synthetic
 *    node_modules tree that really does contain React (transitively, two hops
 *    down), Vue and Svelte, and a dependency that is declared but not
 *    installed. If the walker cannot see those, it cannot see their absence
 *    either.
 *  - `workspaceOnlyReferences` is exercised by a fixture whose manifests carry
 *    `0.0.0`, `workspace:*`, `file:` and `link:` specifiers and a `0.0.0`
 *    installed version.
 *
 * The third negative assertion -- "without importing React" -- is not made
 * here at all, because a test cannot prove it by looking at the consumer's
 * source. It is asserted by the consumer itself, from the MECHANISM: `react`,
 * `react-dom`, `svelte`, `@sveltejs/kit`, `@looprig/harness` and
 * `@looprig/react` are not resolvable from its resolution root, so an import of
 * any of them could not compile or run there. See `consumer/main.ts`.
 *
 * WHAT THE CLOSURE CHECK IS AND IS NOT
 * ------------------------------------
 * `EXPECTED_CLOSURE` is an ALLOWLIST of package names, stated plainly because
 * defect class 6 applies: a rule that names React, Svelte and Harness cannot
 * fail for a fourth framework. An allowlist can, and this one does -- a package
 * enters a consumer's install by being added here on purpose or not at all, so
 * Vue, Solid, Angular or anything else fails it without being named. What it
 * genuinely cannot see, stated rather than implied: a framework that arrives
 * INSIDE an already-admitted package (if `ajv` began vendoring React source,
 * the closure would be unchanged), and anything reached by a mechanism other
 * than a manifest dependency edge -- a postinstall script, a bundled
 * dependency, a dynamic import of a package the manifest does not declare.
 * `test/surface.test.ts`'s module-graph walk covers the last of those for this
 * package's own sources; nothing here covers it for a third party's.
