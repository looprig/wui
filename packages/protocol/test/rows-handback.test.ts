/**
 * §3b rule 2, the negative half: "a non-zero cause loop id is a subagent
 * hand-back and commits no row; without this the UI renders a phantom user
 * message on every hand-back."
 *
 * `handlers_events.go` subscribes `LoopScope{All: true}`, so a parent loop sees
 * every child's frames; a hand-back arrives as a turn opener on the PARENT loop
 * whose `Cause.LoopID` is the CHILD's loop id. It carries a real UserMessage —
 * the subagent's answer, folded back in as the parent's next input — so the
 * only thing separating it from genuine human input is that cause id.
 *
 * The wire strings are the verbatim stdout of `event.MarshalEvent` in
 * `github.com/looprig/harness@v0.30.0` against `core@v0.6.0`, driven by a
 * throwaway main that built real `event.TurnStarted` values (the same producer
 * rows.test.ts's constants came from; see its header for why hand-authoring
 * them would prove nothing).
 *
 * Every case here asserts that the event was SEEN and deliberately not
 * committed — `statusEvents` grows and `nextOrdinal` does not — rather than
 * just that `rows` is empty. `rows` is empty in a fold that ignored the event
 * entirely, so the bare assertion would pass against a decoder that never
 * reached the gate at all.
