/**
 * Pins the wire casing split described in core/content: bare structs with no
 * json tags (TextBlock, ThinkingBlock, ToolUseBlock, RefusalBlock) encode
 * Go-cased field names, while ToolResultBlock defines its own tagged codec
 * (block_json.go's toolResultJSON) and is snake_case. Getting either half
 * backwards yields empty strings and NO error, which is why this is pinned
 * rather than inspected.
 *
 * ## Provenance of the wire strings below
 *
 * `wui/contract/fixtures/` covers NO content block: its only message is
 * `status_running.json`'s `{"role":"assistant"}`, which carries no `blocks`
 * key at all (see messages.test.ts, which decodes it). So there is no vendored
 * fixture to decode here.
 *
 * Rather than hand-author objects — which would only encode this author's
 * belief about the casing, and pass happily if that belief were wrong — every
 * string below is the VERBATIM output of `content.MarshalBlock` /
 * `content.MarshalBlocks` in `github.com/looprig/core@v0.6.0`, the version
 * `github.com/looprig/harness@v0.30.0` (this module's pin, and the version
 * `contract/VERSION` records) requires. They are parsed with JSON.parse so the
 * test consumes bytes, not a JS literal. Regenerate by marshalling the same
 * values against that core version; two of them also appear verbatim in
 * core's own corpus — `{"type":"text","Text":"hello"}` and
 * `{"type":"tool_result","tool_use_id":"tu","content":[{"type":"text","Text":"x"}]}`
 * are seeds in content/block_json_fuzz_test.go (key order is not significant;
 * MarshalBlock round-trips through a map).
 *
 * The NEGATIVE cases are deliberately NOT real wire: the lowercase-`text`
 * block, the Go-cased `tool_result` block, the wrongly-typed fields and the
 * non-object inputs are the shapes a wrong assumption or a corrupted record
 * would produce, and they exist so a decoder that read the wrong key could not
 * pass this file. Each is labelled where it appears.
