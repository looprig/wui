/**
 * §3c: GateOpened/GateResolved fold into a `gates` map, opened on the first and
 * REMOVED on the second.
 *
 * The properties this file exists to hold, in order of what they buy:
 *
 *  - Concurrent gates from parallel loops coexist. That is precisely what
 *    `GET /status`'s single `waiting_gate_id` slot cannot do — it is
 *    last-writer-wins and any GateResolved clears it, so the earlier of two
 *    open gates is lost permanently. A map keyed by gate id is the fix, and it
 *    is only a fix if BOTH entries survive and each resolve removes only its
 *    own.
 *  - The key is the GATE id, not the loop id and not the tool execution id. Two
 *    gates in one loop, or two gates over one tool call, must not collide.
 *  - History and live fold identically, so a reconnect that replays the journal
 *    lands on the same open-gate set as a session watched from the start.
 *
 * The wire shapes below are the same verbatim `event.MarshalEvent` bytes
 * test/gate.test.ts uses, with the ids rewritten per case; see that file's
 * provenance note.

/**
 * ## The COLD gate board: Factory's gate page merged with live journal events
 *
 * `SessionView.gates` above is the per-session live fold. It cannot answer the
 * question this section is about, because it is built from journal events —
 * and a client that has just loaded a session may have no journal stream, no
 * live subscription and no Host at all. The durable
 * `GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/gates` page is a pure durable read (spec §7: "`list`,
 * `status`, `journal`, and initial gate rendering are pure durable reads") and
 * is the only source in that state.
 *
 * ### What the key is, and why it is a pair
 *
 * `(SessionID, GateID)`. A GateID is unique within its session and nothing
 * says it is unique across sessions, so a board that spans sessions — which
 * this one does, because a cold client renders a gate inbox before it has
 * picked a session — must carry both. `publicGateKey` length-prefixes the
 * session id so no pair of ids can collide by containing the delimiter.
 *
 * ### What "stable public order" MEANS
 *
 * The order is the ascending total order over the triple
 * `(sessionId, openedJournalSeq, gateId)`. It is total because the first and
 * third components are the map key, so no two entries tie on all three. It is
 * a pure function of the entry SET — `publicGates` sorts on read and stores no
 * order — so it cannot diverge from the entries the way a maintained index
 * would, and it does not depend on arrival order.
 *
 * That leaves exactly three ways an entry's sort position could move, and each
 * has a case below: a duplicate arrival (the open position is written once, on
 * first observation, and never rewritten), a live resolution (a removal, which
 * preserves the relative order of everything else), and a reload (re-applying
 * a page, which is idempotent on the sort fields).
 *
 * ### What is NOT promised
 *
 * A page merge never REMOVES. A gate that resolved while this client was
 * offline stays on the board until its `GateResolved` is folded or the board
 * is rebuilt from `emptyPublicGateBoard()`. That is pinned below rather than
 * left to a reader's assumption.
