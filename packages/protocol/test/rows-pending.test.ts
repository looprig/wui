/**
 * The optimistic pending row and its resolution (design §3b).
 *
 * ## Why the pending row cannot come from the fold
 *
 * `input_queued` is an EPHEMERAL frame carrying no `delta` and therefore no
 * text — it announces that *something* was queued, not what. The submitted text
 * exists only in the composer that sent it, so the pending row enters the view
 * through an explicit `addPendingRow` call rather than through a fold input.
 * That makes it PER-TAB by construction: a second tab, or the TUI, sees nothing
 * for this submit until `TurnStarted`.
 *
 * ## Why `commandOutcomes` exists
 *
 * A consumer cannot observe pending-row resolution by scanning `rows`:
 * `TurnRejected` commits a NOTICE row, not a user row, and `InputCancelled`
 * commits nothing at all, so the command id would have to be duplicated onto
 * three row kinds to be findable. `commandOutcomes` is the one place a caller
 * asks "what became of the command I submitted", keyed by `Header.Cause
 * .CommandID` — the same key `addPendingRow` files the row under.
 *
 * ## Provenance of the wire strings
 *
 * Verbatim stdout of `event.MarshalEvent` in
 * `github.com/looprig/harness@v0.30.0` (forcing `core@v0.6.0` /
 * `inference@v0.12.0`), driven by a throwaway main package that constructed the
 * real event values. Note what the marshaller REFUSES: a `TurnRejected`
 * carrying a non-zero `TurnID` fails with
 * "event: invalid TurnRejected: TurnID must be zero", so no real rejection
 * envelope has a `turn_id` and the notice's `turnId` is always "".
