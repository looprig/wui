/**
 * The durable gate envelope, and the two PUBLIC gate events that carry it.
 *
 * ## Provenance
 *
 * `contract/fixtures/` has no gate envelope at all, so every `*_WIRE` constant
 * here is the VERBATIM stdout of `event.MarshalEvent` in
 * `github.com/looprig/harness@v0.30.0` — the version `contract/VERSION` pins —
 * driven by a throwaway main that built real `event.GateOpened` /
 * `event.GateResolved` values around real `gate.Gate`s. They are parsed with
 * `JSON.parse` so the tests consume bytes, not JS object literals.
 *
 * MarshalEvent validates identity before it will emit anything, so these bytes
 * also encode which coordinates each gate kind may legally carry: a loop-owned
 * (permission / ask-user) gate is held to the full step profile, while a
 * host-owned one (`resolver: "session"` — the form and open-url elicitations)
 * requires only a SessionID. An arrangement that violated that would have
 * failed to marshal rather than reaching this file.
 *
 * Cases labelled NOT REAL WIRE are shapes a corrupted or legacy record would
 * produce, kept so a decoder reading the wrong key could not pass this file.

/**
 * ## The COLD gate projection (`public_gate_page.schema.json`'s gate record)
 *
 * Everything above this line reads the durable gate envelope off a journal
 * event. The cases below read the OTHER source of the same gate: Factory's
 * `GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/gates` page, which is a pure durable read and is
 * therefore the only source available when no Host is reachable at all.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and are asserted rather than described.
 *
 * REDACTION IS A CLAIM ABOUT A SET, not about the fields someone remembered.
 * The vendored record is `additionalProperties: true` at every level — gate,
 * prompt and control — so a Factory that put a prepared payload, a raw answer,
 * a grant, a credential or a continuation pointer on the wire would hand it
 * straight to a renderer if this decoder filtered a denylist. It does not: it
 * builds a fresh object from a NAMED allowlist, and the allowlist is pinned
 * against the schema's own declared property set in both directions, so a
 * property Core adds later is either classified here or fails
 * "partitions every property".
 *
 * ANSWERABILITY IS NOT THE PROMPT. An open journal event proves presentation,
 * never that anyone can apply a response (gate companion §5.3). So the
 * projection carries Factory's `answerability` verbatim as a plain string —
 * an unrecognized value must survive decoding, exactly as `kind` does — and
 * `acceptsResidentResponse` reads it as permission for ONE thing only.
