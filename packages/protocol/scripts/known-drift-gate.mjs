/**
 * Runs the whole @looprig/protocol suite and gates on it, allowing exactly the
 * wire-contract drift task U0.1 deliberately left behind (test/known-drift.json).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. CI runs `npm test --workspaces`, so U0.1's 154 permitted
 * failures made the node job red, and it stayed red with no status report
 * saying so. The two obvious responses are both wrong. Dropping the workspace
 * from CI would stop running a suite that ci.yml's own comment calls out --
 * "a suite CI never runs is indistinguishable from a passing one". Marking the
 * whole workspace `continue-on-error` would make every future regression in the
 * 26 healthy files invisible for as long as the drift lasts, which is longer
 * than anyone will remember the allowance.
 *
 * So: run every test, then compare the SET OF FAILING FILES against a recorded
 * set. A file failing that is not on the list fails the gate. A file on the
 * list that passes ALSO fails the gate, because an allowance that outlives its
 * cause is how a permanent exemption is born; retiring an entry is a one-line
 * edit in the commit that fixes the drift.
 *
 * THREE floors. Each one was added because the floor above it turned out to
 * have nothing underneath, which is the single defect this script has now been
 * revised three times to fix. The pattern each time: a thing was PRINTED, or
 * CLAIMED in a comment, and asserted nowhere.
 *
 * FLOOR 0 -- WHICH FILES ARE ALLOWED TO BE FILE-GRANULAR. `fileGranular` in
 * test/known-drift.json names the three files exempt from FLOOR 2, and the
 * partition is checked in BOTH directions: an entry inside that list must carry
 * `granularityReason` and must not carry `failingTests`, and an entry outside
 * it must carry `failingTests` and must not carry `granularityReason`.
 *
 * The earlier shape check only demanded exactly ONE of the two fields, which a
 * free-text string satisfies. Swapping test/contract.test.ts's 58-name set for
 * `granularityReason: "flaky"` exited 0 and printed "6 gated to an exact
 * failing-test-name set and 4 stay file-granular" as though that were the
 * design. Every future regression across that file's 62 tests would have been
 * invisible for the rest of the allowance -- the exact state FLOOR 2 exists to
 * end, reachable by editing the JSON alone. So the 7/3 partition is now the
 * pinned fact, not an emergent property of which fields happen to be present.
 *
 * FLOOR 1 -- WHICH FILES RAN, AND HOW MANY TESTS EACH COLLECTED. The first
 * version derived `seen`, printed "26 of 36 test files pass", and asserted
 * NOTHING about it: `git mv test/surface.test.ts test/surface.spec.ts` puts the
 * file outside vitest.config.ts's `include: ["test/**\/*.test.ts"]`, the run
 * reports `10 failed | 25 passed (35)`, and the gate exits 0 with the whole
 * export-surface guard silently not running.
 *
 * Pinning the file NAMES fixed that and left the same hole one level in: a
 * `describe` dropped in a merge-conflict resolution, or a deleted `it`, leaves
 * the file running and passing and the gate green. Deleting one passing `it`
 * from test/blocks.test.ts (24 -> 23) exited 0. So `suiteFiles` maps every
 * expected test file to the number of tests it collects, and both the name sets
 * and the per-file counts must match.
 *
 * The flakiness argument that protects the three HTTP files (below) does not
 * reach these counts: how many tests a file COLLECTS is a property of its
 * source, not of any server or timeout. Verified across independent full runs
 * -- all 36 counts identical, including the three HTTP files, whose per-test
 * OUTCOMES do vary.
 *
 * FLOOR 2 -- WHICH TESTS FAIL INSIDE A DRIFTED FILE. File granularity alone
 * means a new failing `it` in an already-drifted file is invisible: a fresh
 * broken test in test/errors.test.ts took the run to 155 failures and an
 * earlier version of this gate still exited 0. That is defensible ONLY for the
 * three files that drive real HTTP servers under timeouts (transport,
 * host-transport-csrf, serve-transport: 85-90s each, machine-dependent per-test
 * outcomes) -- and it had been applied to all ten, including seven that run in
 * 3-24ms with failing sets reproduced identically across independent runs. The
 * seven record the exact SET OF FAILING TEST NAMES; the three record why they
 * do not, per file, and FLOOR 0 pins which three they are.
 *
 * The residual cost, and it is now the only one: inside those three HTTP files
 * a new failure is not distinguished from the drift. Everything else -- which
 * files run, how many tests each contains, and which tests fail in the other
 * seven -- is asserted.
